### Why
This website is the channel of a guy that makes videos of software engineering and tools and stuff. I get his videos recommended every one in a while, and they are pretty interesting. He talks about news on frameworks and languages.

### Baani Pasrija's Thoughts
I am currently learning C for another class, and on Fireship's page, there was a really cool "C in 100 Seconds" video. I then went through a bunch of other "... in 100 Seconds" videos. All the videos I watched are really interesting. I like how the creator gives gists of different languages (including some esoteric ones) so briefly. I also enjoyed the "10 Programmer Stereotypes" video; hilarious! :joy:

### Aaron Stein's Input :D
I chose [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk) video to talk about from Fireship because I like that he's trying to demistify the coding industry by representing it as an iceberg. This reminds me of the quote professor showed us in class from Alan Turing where Turing posits that: "in that case they would surround the whole of their work with mystery and make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish, whenever any dangerous suggestions were made." I believe that this video is doing a good job of beginning to work against that and demistify the overall topic of computer science for those learning it.
