### Why
This website is the channel of a guy that makes videos of software engineering and tools and stuff. I get his videos recommended every one in a while, and they are pretty interesting. He talks about news on frameworks and languages.

### Baani Pasrija's Thoughts
I am currently learning C for another class, and on Fireship's page, there was a really cool "C in 100 Seconds" video. I then went through a bunch of other "... in 100 Seconds" videos. All the videos I watched are really interesting. I like how the creator gives gists of different languages (including some esoteric ones) so briefly. I also enjoyed the "10 Programmer Stereotypes" video; hilarious! :joy:
